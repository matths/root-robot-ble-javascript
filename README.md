# Root Robot Bluetooth Low Energy Protocol Implementation in Javascript

This is a basic Javascript implementation of the Root Robot Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol documentation.

The protocol was shared by [Root Robotics](https://github.com/RootRobotics), the creators of the Root robot.


## More to come.

I'll add some examples, how to use this code to communicate with the robot, soon.
